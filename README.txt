Instructions to make slideshow slides accessible to the plugin:

1. Upon startup, the server will create a 'displays' folder in \plugins\ImageDisplays

2. Export the slideshow to JPG or PNG images (Powerpoint has functionality to do this)

3. Make sure the slides are named in either alphabetical or numerical order and place them in the 'displays' folder



Instructions to access slideshow slides with plugin:

1. Make sure the person creating the slideshow (in this case a teacher) has administrator privileges on the server. If they do not or you do not know, enter the command 'op <username>' in the server terminal

2. After the slides have been made accessible, the teacher enters the command '/slideshow create' and they will be given a wand

3. With the wand equipped they need to right click the two blocks that they wish to be the corners of the display

4. The wand will disappear and the teacher will be given a blue 'Forward Remote' which, when equipped, will move the slide forward by one slide when they right click

5. After the slideshow moves to the last slide, the next slide will be the first slide

6. To clear the display the teacher must enter the command '/imagedisplays remove' then hit any part of the display
